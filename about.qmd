::: {#hero-heading}
I am a chemical engineer and data scientist. Previously I studied at Caltech and Stanford.

My interests are at the intersection of biotechnology and data science. I'm excited by new biotech inventions and tools for computational biology as well as ideas that can be applied towards achieving better health outcomes and equity. On the technical front, I enjoy building vibrant visualizations, predictive modeling and applying analytics for social good.

### Experience

I have worked in multiple areas of biotechnology including small molecule drugs, large molecule protein therapies and medical devices.

Some highlights:

-   Building analytics and software tools for profiling cancer patient adaptive immune repertoires leading to the the discovery of tumor-specific antibodies

-   Engineering and design efforts applied to the first digital pill ([Ingestible sensor medical device](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25069107/))

-   Small molecule drug development including contributions to first single tablet regimen to [cure Hepatitis C](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2014/10/us-food-and-drug-administration-approves-gileads-harvoni-ledipasvirsofosbuvir-the-first-oncedaily-single-tablet-regimen-for-the-treatment-of)
